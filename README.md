# Bricks_breaker_game
A Bricks Breaker game is a classic arcade-style game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball, aiming to break a wall of bricks at the top of the screen. The objective is to clear all the bricks using the bouncing ball while preventing it from falling off the bottom of the screen. Each time the ball hits a brick, it disappears, and the player earns points. Some bricks may require multiple hits to break, and there are often power-ups, obstacles, or special bricks with varying effects. The game continues until all bricks are cleared, or the player runs out of lives. Bricks Breaker games are known for their simple yet addictive gameplay.
